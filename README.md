# wasm_react_pwa_skeleton
Skeleton project for using WebAssembly in a React project that can be used offline as a PWA

This project was created using https://lyceum-allotments.github.io/2016/06/emscripten-and-sdl2-tutorial-part-7-get-naked-owl/ as a base for the WebAssembly.

# This is still a WIP

# Getting Started
1. Make sure you have emscripten installed and working. Instructions can be found at: https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html#tutorial
2. Make sure you have a Web Server which can feed up files. The author of this document used Web Server for Chrome for simplicity.
3. From the project directory you can run `make` which will compile the source.
4. Point your Web Server to the project directory and load up the skeleton_project.html
